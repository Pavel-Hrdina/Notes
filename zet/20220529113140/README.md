# How to make a zettel entery 

This is the body of the zettle (That means "slip").

This is a bullet list 

* First bullet
* Second bullet

This is an orderd list 

1. First 
2. Second 

When I want to write some code:

```go
package main 

import fmt

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

*This text is italic*, **this text is bold** and ***this text is bold italic***.

What if I want text that looks like `code`?

If I want a url to print I would use something like this?

https://www.example.com/

* Ideally I want references at the bottom
